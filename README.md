Description: This series of Max pads takes two banks of .wav files and with the use of a scroll bar, you can have a transition between two sets of sounds by adjusting the bar 
in soundscape 1. On one side is nature sounds and the other is sounds you would hear in Chicago. This was inspired by a trip to Morse Park.
